# TARS-AI Documentation

This is where you can find our documentation, guides, and more.

To contribute to the documentation, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.

If you do not have `pnpm` installed, install it using:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

To run the website locally, run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

You can now view your changes to the website live at http://localhost:3000/

It is recommended to install the MDX VSCode Extension for development.

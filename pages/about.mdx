The TARS-AI community initially formed around [Charles Diaz's original forum post on hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/charlesdiaz/how-to-build-your-own-replica-of-tars-from-interstellar-224833), where Joseph (@pyrater) started the TARS-AI project as an open-source off-shoot in late November 2024 with a small team of passionate builders.

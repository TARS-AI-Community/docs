# 3D Printing Guide
These are instructions for the TARS-AI 3D printed parts.

## File Locations

There are two versions of the 3D printed files available:

1. **Heat-Inserts Version** - Located in the [V2_files/heat_inserts version](https://github.com/TARS-AI-Community/TARS-AI/tree/dev/V2_files/heat_inserts%20version/V2_3d%20printed%20files) directory
2. **Normal Version** - Located in the [V2_files/normal_version](https://github.com/TARS-AI-Community/TARS-AI/tree/dev/V2_files/normal_version/V2_3d_printed_files) directory

## Choosing What to Print

The files are organized into several main directories:

- `LEFT LEG NO ARMS` - Components for the left leg without arm attachments
- `LEFT LEG` - Components for the left leg with arm attachments
- `RIGHT LEG NO ARMS` - Components for the right leg without arm attachments
- `RIGHT LEG` - Components for the right leg with arm attachments
- `TORSO` - Core body components

### Build Options

1. **Building TARS with Arms**
   - Print all files from the `LEFT LEG` and `RIGHT LEG` folders
   - Print all files from the `TORSO` folder

2. **Building TARS without Arms**
   - Print all files from the `LEFT LEG NO ARMS` and `RIGHT LEG NO ARMS` folders
   - Print all files from the `TORSO` folder

## Printing Guidelines

- Files denoted with (TPU) should be printed in TPU if available. Otherwise, PLA/PETG is acceptable.
- You can use this [TARS_PrintPlates.3mf](https://github.com/TARS-AI-Community/TARS-AI/blob/dev/V2_files/heat_inserts%20version/V2_3d%20printed%20files/TARS_PrintPlates.3mf) file as reference for how you can organize your print plates and identify components.
  - However, please note that it is NOT RECOMMENDED to print the plates exactly as shown in the file. The printer settings provided in the file may not work for your printer/preferences.
  - Ideally you print plates with components of different filament in separate print sessions to avoid wasting material.
    - The only exception to this is the Upper Lid, where multiple filaments are used in the same individual component for multi-color printing.
- Only print the supports that you need.

## Next Steps
Also see the [Bill of Materials](/build/bom). 

Once you have everything: it's time for [assembly](/build/assemble).

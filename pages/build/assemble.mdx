# Assembly Guide
Before assembly, check both the [Bill of Materials](/build/bom) and [3D printing guide](/build/3d_print) to make sure you have all of the parts.

Assembly guide for Hardware v2.0 coming soon.

For now, see the pinned message in the Discord Server's #documentation channel.

## Next Steps
Once assembly is complete, move to [software setup](/build/setup).

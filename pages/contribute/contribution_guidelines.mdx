# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from everyone, whether you‚Äôre a seasoned robotics engineer or just starting out. Here‚Äôs how you can get involved:

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in many forms, including:

- Code Contributions at [TARS-AI](https://github.com/TARS-AI-Community/TARS-AI).
- CAD/Electrical Contributions at [TARS-AI](https://github.com/TARS-AI-Community/TARS-AI).
- Documentation at [Docs](https://github.com/TARS-AI-Community/docs).
- Bug Reports.
- Feature Requests.

To get started, please follow these steps. For those new to GitHub, please see [New to Git and GitHub?](#new-to-git-and-github) below.

<Steps>
### Fork the Repository
<br />

<Image src="/contribute/instructions_0.png" alt="Instructions Image 0" width={1000} height={300} />

Click the ‚ÄúFork‚Äù button at the top-right of a repository page to create your own copy of the repository.

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  Forking allows you to make changes in your own copy of the repository without affecting the original.
</Callout>

### Clone Your Fork
<br />

<Image src="/contribute/instructions_1.png" alt="Instructions Image 1" width={1000} height={300} />

Open a terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the repository 
and clone your forked repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your username>/<repository name>.git
cd <repository name>
```

### Set Up Remote Repositories

Check the remote URLs. You should see your fork as `origin`:
```bash
git remote -v
```

Add the original repository as the upstream remote:
```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:TARS-AI-Community/<repository name>.git
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
    This setup helps you fetch updates from the main repository to keep your fork up-to-date.
</Callout>

### Create a New Branch

**Always** create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b <branch name>
```
Use descriptive branch names, e.g., `add-new-feature` or `fix-bug`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
    Branches help you isolate changes and organize features.
</Callout>

### Make Your Changes
Add, edit, or delete files in the repository and test them locally.

### Commit Your Changes
Commit your work with a clear message:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add a clear description of your changes"
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
    For non-binary files, Git tracks changes for version control. For CAD files like STL or STEP, Git stores the files as blobs without versioning.
</Callout>

### Push to Your Fork
Push your changes to your forked repository:
```bash
git push origin <branch name>
```

### Submit a Pull Request
<br />

Once your changes are ready to be merged with the original, go to the *original repository* and click **Compare & pull request** (if available) or **New Pull Request**. 
<br />

Please provide the information above in the PR and click **Create pull request**.

### Review and Merge

Notify @Pyrater or @Alex W on Discord in the `#repo` channel if your PR is ready for review. If changes are requested, update your branch locally, commit, and push again. GitHub will automatically update the PR.

Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main repository. **Congratulations!**

### Keeping Your Fork Up-to-Date
If other contributors make changes to the main repository, keep your fork in sync:
1. Fetch updates from the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```
2. Merge updates into your branch:
   ```bash
   git merge upstream/main
   ```
3. Push updates to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
</Steps>

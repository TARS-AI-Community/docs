# Contributing to Documentation

## Overview

Our documentation is written in MDX (Markdown + JSX) and uses [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) as the documentation framework. The documentation source files are hosted on GitHub at [TARS-AI-Community/docs](https://github.com/TARS-AI-Community/docs).

## Getting Started

1. Follow the general [contribution guidelines](/contribute/guidelines) to fork and clone the docs repository.
2. Make sure you have `node` installed. If you do not have it installed, install it at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. Make sure you have `pnpm` installed. If you do not have it installed, install it using:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:   
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
5. You can now view your changes to the website live at http://localhost:3000/

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized as follows:

- `pages/` - Contains all documentation pages
  - `_meta.tsx` - Defines the navigation structure
  - `index.mdx` - Home page
  - Other directories contain section-specific content

## Writing Guidelines

<Callout type="info">
  It is recommended to install the **MDX VSCode Extension** for development.
</Callout>

### File Format
- Use `.mdx` extension for documentation files
- Place images in the `public/` directory
- Use relative links for internal navigation

### Markdown Features
- Use headings appropriately (H1 for page title, H2 for sections, etc.)
- Include code examples with syntax highlighting
- Use callouts for important information
- Add images with captions when helpful

### Components
We provide several built-in components:
- `<Callout>` for important notes
- `<Steps>` for step-by-step instructions
- `<Tabs>` for organizing related content
- `<Image>` for responsive images

Example:
```mdx
<Callout type="info">
  Important information goes here
</Callout>
```

## Testing Changes

1. Preview your changes locally using `pnpm dev`
2. Check that:
   - All links work
   - Images display correctly
   - Code blocks are properly formatted
   - Navigation structure is correct
3. After verifying your changes, commit and merge your changes following the [contribution guidelines](/contribute/guidelines).
4. Once your changes have been merged, your changes will be built with GitHub Actions.

  Once the build is complete (âœ…), your changes will be deployed to the live website within 10 minutes.
</Callout>

## Contributing to the BoM

### Adding New Items

To add a new item to the Bill of Materials:

1. Add the item to `lib/productLinks.ts`:

```typescript
export const productLinks: Record<string, ProductLink> = {
  // ... existing items ...
  "new-product-id": {
    id: "new-product-id",
    name: "Product Name",
    countryLinks: {
    "US": "https://www.example.com/product-us",
    // Add more country-specific links as available
    },
    defaultLink: "https://www.example.com/product-us" // Usually the US link
  },
};
```

2. Add the item to the BoM table in `pages/build/bom.mdx`:
```mdx
<Tr>
  <Td>Product Name</Td>
  <Td>Product description</Td>
  <Td>1</Td>
  <Td><CountryLink productId="new-product-id">Buy</CountryLink></Td>
</Tr>
```

### Adding Country-Specific Links

To add links for your country to existing items:

1. Find the item in `lib/productLinks.ts`
2. Add your country's link to the `countryLinks` object. You can find your country's code (i.e. "GB" for Great Britain) under `lib/countries.ts`.
```typescript
"raspberry-pi-5": {
  id: "raspberry-pi-5",
  name: "Raspberry Pi 5",
  countryLinks: {
  "US": "https://www.amazon.com/...",
  "GB": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/...", // Add your country
  "DE": "https://www.amazon.de/..." // Add your country
  },
  defaultLink: "https://www.amazon.com/..."
},
```

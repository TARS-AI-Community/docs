# Release Guidelines

This document outlines the process and guidelines for releasing new versions of TARS-AI. Following these guidelines ensures consistent, high-quality releases that maintain the project's standards.

## Guidelines

<Callout type="warning">
All current development should stay under `v0.x.x` (with the exception of the TARS-AI repository). Avoid using `v1.0.0` for any component until we have:
- Lock in a stable hardware platform
- Have reliable and tested software integrations
- Provide complete, reproducible BoM and setup instructions
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Please review the [Versioning](/contribute/release_guidelines#understanding-version-numbers) section for more information on how version numbers are assigned.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Verify and Test

Before creating a release, ensure all changes have been properly verified in the development branch:

**Software:** [TARS-AI](https://github.com/TARS-AI-Community/TARS-AI)
1. Code has been reviewed by a maintainer
2. Changes are clearly documented in the PR description
3. All dependencies are properly versioned and updated
4. Changes have been tested on a completed build and no unintended regressions are introduced
5. *IF NECESSARY*: A corresponding `docs/` PR has been created to update the Software Setup Guide

**Hardware:** [hardware](https://github.com/TARS-AI-Community/hardware)
1. Updates have been reviewed by a maintainer
2. Changes are clearly documented in the PR description
3. 3D printed parts, wiring, and tolerances have been tested on a completed build
4. *IF NECESSARY*: A corresponding `docs/` PR has been created to update:
   - The Bill of Materials
   - The 3D Printing Guide
   - The Step-by-Step Assembly Guide

<Callout type="warning">
  The template PRs for the software and hardware repositories will be provided by @alexander-wang03.
</Callout>

Once all items in the checklist have been verified, the PRs can be merged into the `main` branch.

### Release Documentation Package

After merging the PRs, prepare the documentation package and store it in the `releases` directory. It should be a zip file containing:
- Bill of Materials (CSV)
- 3D Printing Guide (PDF)
- Assembly Guide (PDF)
- Software Setup (PDF)

```
releases/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vX.Y.Z/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs-vX.Y.Z.zip    # Contains: BoM, Assembly Guide, Setup Guide, 3D Printing Guide
```

<Callout type="warning">
@alexander-wang03 is currently creating a script that will automatically generate and store the documentation package in the `releases` directory.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Do not modify or delete files in the `releases/` directory after they have been published. Each release should remain exactly as it was when published to maintain reproducibility.
</Callout>

### Creating GitHub Releases

After creating the documentation package, use **GitHub Releases** to attach the changelog and documentation package (if necessary) to the release. This can be the same as the PR description.

<Image
  src="/contribute/tag-release.png"
  alt="Example of a GitHub Release with tags"
  width={800}
  height={400}
  className="mt-6 rounded-lg"
/> 

Each GitHub Release will have a **Git Tag** to tag every stable release. This is the actual version number of the release and what will be used to track the release in the [Releases page](/releases). It will be in the format `vX.Y.Z`.

### Update the Release Page 

After creating the GitHub Release, update the [Releases page](/releases) to track compatibility between versions with an entry:

| TARS Version | Software | Hardware | Documentation Package | Release Date | Description |
| ------------ | -------- | -------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| v0.0.0 | [v3.0.0](https://github.com/TARS-AI-Community/TARS-AI/tree/3.0) | [v0.0.0](https://github.com/TARS-AI-Community/hardware/tree/v0.0.0) | [Download](https://github.com/TARS-AI-Community/docs/tree/main/releases/v0.0.0) | May 25, 2025 | High-level overview of the Release |

- Software and Hardware columns link to their respective repository tag versions
- Documentation Package column links to the documentation package in the `releases` directory

</Steps>

### Summary of the Release Process

1. Finalize and test hardware and software changes
2. Create versioned documentation packages
3. Create GitHub Release with changelog and tag/release number (X.Y.Z)
4. Update Releases page
5. Post to community (Discord, docs, etc.) üòä

## Understanding Version Numbers

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

### üõú Software (`vX.Y.Z`)

- **MAJOR (X)**: Breaking API or behavioral changes
- **MINOR (Y)**: New features, hardware interface changes, backwards-compatible
- **PATCH (Z)**: Bug fixes, performance improvements, docs tweaks

### üõ†Ô∏è Hardware (`vX.Y.Z`)

- **MAJOR (X)**: Major mechanical/wiring redesigns (e.g., servo mount relocation)
- **MINOR (Y)**: Backwards-compatible improvements (e.g., wire cleanup, tolerances)
- **PATCH (Z)**: Small tweaks, fix interferences, better labels

### ü§ñ TARS (`vX.Y`)

TARS version numbers represent the overall state of the project:

- **MAJOR (X)**: Foundational changes to TARS's core architecture, principles, or operation
  - Complete redesign of the robot's core functionality
  - Major changes to how TARS components interact
  - Breaking changes that affect the entire ecosystem

- **MINOR (Y)**: Significant changes in either software or hardware
  - Major version changes in software (breaking API changes)
  - Major version changes in hardware (redesigns)
  - New features that substantially enhance capabilities

<Callout type="info">
Note: TARS versions do not have a patch number, as minor updates to components are tracked in their respective repositories.
</Callout>

For example:
- If software has a breaking change (v1.0.0 ‚Üí v2.0.0), TARS goes from v1.**2** ‚Üí v1.**3**
- If hardware has a major redesign (v1.0.0 ‚Üí v2.0.0), TARS goes from v1.**3** ‚Üí v1.**4**
- If TARS fundamentally changes how it operates, it goes from **v1.4** ‚Üí **v2.0**

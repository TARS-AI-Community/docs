We're building a hub for robotics enthusiasts with TARS-AIâ€”an open-source project inspired by *Interstellar*.

### Our Mission
TARS-AI is an open-source initiative dedicated to engineering a fully autonomous and interactive robot inspired by TARS. Our goal is to create a modular, scalable, and community-driven robotics platform.

### Our Robot
**TARS-AI** is designed with:
- **Modular Software Architecture**: Components for speech, personality, memory, intent classification, vision, and servo control.
- **Interactive AI**: A chatbot-based personality with real-time responses.
- **Affordable & Scalable Design**: Open-source hardware and software for easy replication and customization.
- **Open-Source Collaboration**: We welcome developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to contribute.

### Join the Community
Build your own TARS and contribute to the future of robotics! We welcome your feedback, issues, and pull requests in [GitHub](https://github.com/TARS-AI-Community/TARS-AI) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/uXkqkz3mJJ).
